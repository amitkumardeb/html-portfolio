	Roses are beautiful and classic flowers that have captivated people for
	centuries. They have inspired countless poets, writers, composers,songwriters
	and artists over the years with their elegant blooms and contrasting
	thorns. The life cycle of a rose can be related back to our own lives. We
	go through phases of growth, pruning and rough winters that can leave
	us bare but in the end, we (like roses) will regrow and prosper again.
	Roses are the epitome of beauty, from their dazzling color combinations
	and their sweet scent to their rows of delicate petals. They make a
	stunning addition to a garden or gift â€” these quotes about roses and
	beauty are a great way to show someone that you honor their inner and
	outer radiance.
